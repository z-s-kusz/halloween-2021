              <p>We were all dared to stay the night of All Hallows Eve at the haunted house in our small hometown,
              <em>Crystal Cove</em>. We all know of the house as a looming figure that sits atop the highest hill at the edge of town. Rusting gates surround
              the old building like a maw of jagged, jutting teeth. After settling over the decades, it sits amidst weeds and neglect,
              broken windows smattered chaotically across its facade.</p>
              <p>At our school, <em>Tempest High</em>, there are several rumors as to why
              the house is haunted: a witch lived there, a mother drowned her children there to punish her cheating husband, it was
              the site of grisly murders, or it was built on top of unmarked graves, etc.</p>
              <p>The most prominent rumor we have heard is if you enter this house you will most likely not come out alive and, if you
              do, you will as Chad says, <x>"Be totally fucked up, bro"</x>. We all took this dare and we will meet at the house's gates at
              5:30PM.</p>
              <p>Whether you took this dare out of morbid curiosity, as a way to prove what you already believe to be true, or
              just bragging rights, you have sealed your fate to a hellish night at <em>Erebus Manor.</em></p>
